Study of elephant egocentric social networks through time, using data from Amboseli National Park

Using the models developed in the repository I have very poorly named "test", this project now digs deeper into the role of age in social network structure by considering only the egocentric networks of some of the most well monitored elephants in the Amboseli population, and comparing their individual trends over time in terms of network position and age of common associates.

## Questions to be answered:
1) Do males show long-term associations with the same individuals?
2) Do certain individuals consistently show greater or lesser centrality than others across all ages: is there a social element to their personalities?
3) If there are times where there is a common theme to the changes in behaviour across all individuals, is this linked to an environmental change of some kind?
